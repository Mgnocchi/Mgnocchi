Mathematician by formation, currently trying to become a DevOps engeneer and learning everything that grabs my interest. 
A long journey, but an interesting and stimulating one.

Here you might find some personal projects I occupy my free time with, some undergrad level code I made back before I got my degree and about my personal journey in learing and in setting up the best environment in which to do so.

You may find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-gnocchi-08aaa7231/) or directly write me a mail at marco.gnocchi1@gmail.com
